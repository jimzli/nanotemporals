Nanosecond-precision temporal types for Java

In modern-day neocybernetics applications, such as high-frequency electronic/algorithmic trading, high-frequency time series econometrics, robotics, and others,
timestamps of necessity have nanosecond precision.

This library implements nanosecond-precision temporal types for such applications.

We would like to thank all those former and current colleagues from whom we have learned so much about Java programming.

We welcome requests for collaboration on maintaining this library and taking it further.

Comments, bug fixes, and new ideas are most welcome.
